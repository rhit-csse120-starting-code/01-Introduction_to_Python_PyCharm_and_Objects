#
#   Read the code below.  Predict (in your head)
#   what will get printed (i.e., displayed) when the code runs.
#
#   Then run this module by right clicking anywhere in this window
#   and then selecting:
#        Run 'name of file'
#   (i.e.  Run 'm1fe_comments_string...')
#
#       Or, use the Windows keyboard shortcut:
#           Control + Shift + Function-F10
#       That is, hold the Control, Shift and Function keys down
#       and press the F10 key.
#
#       To run the SAME module again, you can press the "Play" button,
#       which is the green, rightward-pointing triangle on the toolbar
#       that is above and to the right (and also on the toolbar on the
#       left-had-side of the Run window).
#
#   Confirm that you see the output in the  "Run"  window that appears.
#
#       Note: We strongly recommend that you click on the "Gear" symbol
#       at the top-right part of that window and select
#           Move to  ~  Right Top
#       to make the output easier to see (and the code window larger).
#       Do that now if you have not already done so.
#
#   Confirm that the output is what you expected, asking questions as desired.
#
#   Make the entire Pycharm window big and resize its windows as desired.
#
#   This module is just an example (m1fe, note the   e   ).
#   It has a FOLLOW-ME video associated with it (note the   f  ),
#   or your instructor will do it with you via "Live Coding" in class.
#
#   After you have read and run the code,
#   feel free to play with it briefly, then move on to m2.
