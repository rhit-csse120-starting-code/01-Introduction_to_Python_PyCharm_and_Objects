# TODO: 2.
#   Write code that accomplishes the following (and ONLY the following):
#  _
#    a. Imports rosegraphics as rg.
#    b. Constructs a TurtleWindow.
#    c. Constructs a SimpleTurtle with a "blue", thickness 1 Pen.
#    d. Constructs a SimpleTurtle with shape "turtle"
#        and a "red", thickness 5 Pen.
#    e. Makes the SimpleTurtle with a "blue" Pen:
#        1. Go straight UP 200 pixels.
#        2. Lift its pen UP
#             (so that the next movements do NOT leave a "trail").
#             HINT: Use the "dot trick" to figure out how to do this.
#        3. Go to the Point whose:
#             -- x-coordinate is 35 times the sine of 0.75 (radians)
#             -- y-coordinate is 4 raised to the math.pi power
#             HINT: Use the "dot trick" to figure out how to go to a Point.
#        4. Put its pen DOWN
#             (so that the next movements will return to leaving a "trail").
#        5. Change its Pen's color to "green" and thickness 20.
#        6. Go down and to the left at a 45 degree angle, for 150 pixels.
#    f. Makes the SimpleTurtle with a "red" Pen, with shape "turtle":
#        1. Go 50 times the cosine of 0.3 (radians) pixels straight to the LEFT.
#        2. Then go 150 pixels straight DOWN.
#    g. Makes the SimpleTurtle with a Pen that was "blue" but is now "green":
#        1. Continue forward (in the same direction that it has been going)
#             75 more pixels.
#    h. Asks your TurtleWindow to wait for a mouse click.
#  _
#   See the  turtles.pdf  file for what the final result should look like.
#  _
#   Don't forget to:
#     - Import rosegraphics
#     - Construct a TurtleWindow
#            [remember the required PARENTHESES for constructing an object!]
#         at the BEGINNING of your code.
#     - Ask your  TurtleWindow to   close_on_mouse_click
#          as the LAST line of your code.  (Again, parentheses needed!)
#   See the beginning and end of   m7e_loopy_turtles   for an example.
#  _
#   As always, test by running the module.

# TODO: 3. After you have successfully written and tested code per the above
#   (get help as needed!), be sure that you understand how to:
#     -- CONSTRUCT an INSTANCE of a CLASS (we call such instances OBJECTS).
#     -- Make an object   ** DO **   something by using a METHOD.
#     -- Reference an object's   ** DATA **   by using an INSTANCE VARIABLE.
#  _
#   If those concepts are not clear to you, ASK FOR HELP.
#   Once you understand those concepts, change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#  _
#   As always, COMMIT-and-PUSH when you are done with this module.
